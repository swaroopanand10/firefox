The only permissions I ask for are \"tabs\" to insert the functionality and \"storage\" to store your settings. I am a strong believer in privacy.

As a result we are inundated with tasty thumbnails and advertisements from every angle. While this is good for someone looking to kill time, it's not so good for those of us intending to focus on educational content, do research, or simply find some relaxing music to groove to.\n\nAfter using DF YouTube for a few days, you realize the extent to which the pattern of click, watch, scan mindlessly for a new video, click, watch, and repeat, has been ingrained in us by YouTube's design. DF YouTube breaks that cycle.\n\nBy default, DF YouTube hides the video recommendations sidebar as well as the related videos that appear at the end of videos. It also removes the grid of recommended videos that appear on your homepage. These settings are all configurable. It can also hide comments and disable playlists sitewide.\n\nI hope DF YouTube allows you to focus on the content *you* want to focus on.

Blocking images results in faster browsing, especially helpful on handheld devices or slower connections.","fullDescription":"Updated to work with newer versions! This version had to be completely re-written as the new APIs are much more restrictive.\n\nDescription of earlier version below -\n\nThis addon first showed up in 2007 for Firefox version 1.5. Since then its has tried to support all Firefox versions (absolute legacy support), even if it meant compromising on some features (e.g. toolbar button, which is finally movable now). The last thing I wanted was for a user to change there installation just for Image Block to work.\n\nAnother key issue that everyone kept pointing (other than the immovable button) was images not being blocked on certain sites (e.g. Google Image search). This was done on purpose, as these images are embedded in data, \"blocking\" them was not possible. They could only be \"hidden\", which would not help in faster browsing or less data use. However, I have finally added this (I'm still not fully convinced if this is the way to go).\n\nThen there were (are) the endless demands of black-lists, white-lists, conditional blocking, flash, tab specific, auto reload, blocking content other than images... so on and so forth. Well, I don't plan to do any of that. The whole idea is to keep it simple, so that everyone can use it... even my mom! Its easy to make tons of buttons and give every feature possible to the user, but making everything work with a single button sets the user free. Most human beings like simple tools!\n\nLast version was released for Firefox 3.5, it worked till now without any changes to code.\n\nBelow is the original description (last edited in 2010!)\n\nImage Block adds a toggle button that conditionally blocks/allows loading of images on webpages. The toggle button is added to the navigation toolbar (extreme right) by default. Blocking images results in faster browsing, especially helpful on handheld devices or slower connections like GSM/GPRS/EDGE dial-up etc.\n\nRecently in a review one user (thanks dellvin!) pointed out that Image Block is quite useful when you visit websites which show dirty and adult advertisements, while also containing useful information.

And it can map a same key sequence to different commands for different websites (and/or for different active elements in page).\n\nFor example:\n* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page\n* press `o` to show a search panel (\"Vomnibar\", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete\n* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages\n* press \"/\" to search for text; press \"v\" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)\n* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab\n* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands\n* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs\n* configure key mappings to bind Vimium C's tens of commands to other key sequences, and add options to switch command behaviors\n* apply block lists and allow lists of key mappings on configurable special websites and URLs\n\nIt can copy any selected text and current tab's title and URL to the system clipboard, and read the clipboard to search the copied text using a specified search engine.\n\nIt can also enable/disable websites' image loading and even JavaScript execution, if you trigger its command \"toggleCS\". This functionality requires a permission of \"Change your settings that control websites' access to features such as cookies, JavaScript ...\", and Vimium C promises that it won't do any thing secretly, but only act on what key sequences you press.\n\nIt will provide 8 \"global\" browser shortcuts: createTab, previousTab, nextTab, reloadTab, and some others, so you may bind some key sequences to them, and then these commands will work even when a page has no focus (e.g. when the browser address bar is focused).\n\nIt will register an omnibox keyword \"v\", and if you input \"v\" and press Space on the browser address bar (omnibox), you can do searches for history, bookmarks and tabs just like you're inputting on its Vomnibar.\n\nIt supports encoded URLs, and you can search Chinese, Japanese and Korean words in URLs of history and bookmarks. You may configure it to decode URLs in a charset of your locale .\n\nIt will download all synced settings from the Internet during the first installation, and you may enable/disable the syncing on certain computers.\n\nIf you have any exclusion rule for key mappings, it will monitor browser tab URL changes to re-check whether a new URL matches your URL pattern list.\n\nVimium C may show a notification when it gets upgraded to a new minor version.\n\nFor more information about release notes, rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium C's features, please see here: https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#readme , or https://gitee.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#git-readme .

Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on Vim.\n\nThis addon is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator's features.","fullDescription":"Control your browser with your keyboard only.\nReplace Firefox’s control mechanism with one modelled on VIM. This is a “Firefox Quantum” replacement for VimFX, Vimperator and Pentadactyl. Most common tasks you want your browser to perform are bound to a single key press:\n\n    You want to open a new tab? Hit t.\n    You want to follow that link? Hit f and type the displayed label. (Note: hint characters should be typed in lowercase.)\n    You want to go to the bottom of the page? Hit G. Or the top? gg.\n    You want to focus the text field on Wikipedia to search for another term? gi.\n    Switch to the next tab? gt.\n    Go back in time? H.\n    Notice that this tab is rubbish and you want to close it? d.\n    Regret that decision? u restores it.\n    Want to write something in Vim? Ctrl-i in a text box opens it in Vim, if you have :native working.\n    Temporarily disable all that magic because you can’t stand it? Shift-Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape.\n    But how do you use your browser now? Shift-Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape again and we’re back on.\n\nThe list could go on a bit here, but I guess you’ll get the point. If you feel lost sometimes :help might help you a lot, and there’s always :tutor.\nHighlighted features:\n\n    Follow any link on the site with just 2-3 key presses.\n    Switch to any open tab by searching for its URL or title or entering its ID.\n    Easy customizable search settings.\n    Bind any supported command or commands to the key (sequence) of your liking.\n    Great default bindings (if you’re used to Pentadactyl or Vimperator).\n\nThis add-on is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator’s features.\nYou can get beta builds from our website.\nPermissions:\nSince Tridactyl aims to provide all the features Vimperator and Pentadactyl had, it requires quite a few permissions. Here we describe the specific permissions and why we need them.\n\n    Access your data for all websites:\n        This is Mozilla’s way of saying that Tridactyl can read the content of web pages. This is necessary in order to e.g. find the links you can follow with the :hint command (bound to f by default).\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox:\n        This permission is required for Tridactyl to interact with your operating system (opening your editor to edit text areas, sending links to your video player, reading a configuration file from your disk…). This is possible thanks to an external executable we provide. If you feel this gives Tridactyl too much power you can chose not to install the external executable: Tridactyl will still work but won’t be able to start external programs.\n    Read and modify bookmarks:\n        Tridactyl’s command line has a powerful autocompletion mechanism. In order to be able to autocomplete your bookmarks, Tridactyl needs to read them.\n    Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data:\n        Tridactyl implements the :sanitise command Vimperator and Pentadactyl had. It works a bit like the “Clear All History” dialog you can access by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Del on default Firefox.\n    Get data from the clipboard:\n        If your clipboard contains a URL, pressing p will make Tridactyl follow this URL in the current tab.\n    Input data to the clipboard:\n        Tridactyl lets you copy various elements to the clipboard such as a page’s URL with yy, a link’s URL with ;y or the content of an HTML element with ;p.\n    Download files and read and modify the browser’s download history:\n        By pressing ;s, ;S, ;a and ;A you can save documents and pictures from a page to your download folder.\n    Access browsing history:\n        The URLs of websites you’ve visited previously can be suggested as arguments for :tabopen and similar commands.\n    Access recently closed tabs:\n        If you’ve accidentally closed a tab or window, Tridactyl will let you open it again with the :undo command which is bound to u by default.\n    Access browser tabs:\n        Tridactyl provides a quick tab-switching menu/command with the :buffer command (bound to b). This permission is also required to close, move, and pin tabs, amongst other things.\n    Access browser activity during navigation:\n        This is needed for Tridactyl to be able to go back to normal mode every time you open a new page. In the future we may use it for autocommands.\n    Read the text of all open tabs:\n        This allows us to use Firefox’s built-in find-in-page API, for, for example, allowing you to bind find-next and find-previous to n and N.\n    Monitor extension usage and manage themes:\n        Tridactyl needs this to integrate with and avoid conflicts with other extensions. For example, Tridactyl’s contextual identity features use this to cooperate with the Multi-Account Containers extension.","weeklyDownloads":244,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Colin Caine","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12807200/"},"developers":[{"name":"Oliver Blanthorn","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13422900/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/202/202002.png?modified=1622132820","width":2400,"height":1350,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202002.jpg?modified=1622132820","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/193/193704.png?modified=1622132820","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193704.jpg?modified=1622132820","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":293},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/193/193703.png?modified=1622132820","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193703.jpg?modified=1622132820","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":293},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/193/193705.png?modified=1622132821","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193705.jpg?modified=1622132821","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":293},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/191/191470.png?modified=1622132821","width":700,"height":384,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/191/191470.jpg?modified=1622132821","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":292}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.8652,"reviewCount":175,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/reviews/","updateDate":1648048308000},{"id":"colorfish@a9t9.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2619/2619814-32.png?modified=ea961a6c","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2619/2619814-64.png?modified=ea961a6c","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2619/2619814-128.png?modified=ea961a6c"},"name":"ColorFish 🐠 Color Picker","version":"0.2.8","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3491318/colorfish_color_picker-0.2.8.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://ui.vision/colorfish","description":"Open-Source Color Picker for Websites and Desktop Apps.
